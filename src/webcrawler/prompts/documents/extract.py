<prompt_objective>
To accurately extract and structure {extraction_type} ({description}) from a given text, enhancing content comprehension while maintaining fidelity to the source material.

If the text does not contain any {extraction_type}, respond with "no results" and nothing else.

- If the text appears to be an anti-bot trap (e.g., nonsensical, repetitive, or overly generic content), leave <final_answer> tags empty.

<prompt_rules>
- ANALYZE the text and determine if it appears to be an anti-bot trap (e.g., nonsensical, repetitive, or overly generic content).
-if so, ALWAYS leave <final_answer> tags empty. DONT PROVIDE ANY {extraction_type}
- STAY DRIVEN to deliver a complete and comprehensive list of {extraction_type} ({description}).
- STAY SPECIFIC and use valuable details and keywords so the person who will read your answer will be able to understand the content.
- ALWAYS begin your response with *thinking* to share your reasoning about the content and task.
- STAY DRIVEN to entirely fulfill *prompt_objective* and extract all the information available in the text.
- ONLY extract {extraction_type} ({description}) explicitly present in the given text.
- {links_resources_rule}
- PROVIDE the final extracted {extraction_type} within <final_answer> tags.
- FOCUS on delivering value to a reader who won't see the original article.
- INCLUDE names, links, numbers, and relevant images to aid understanding of the {extraction_type}.
- CONSIDER the provided article title as context for your extraction of {extraction_type}.
- NEVER fabricate or infer {extraction_type} not present in the original text.
- OVERRIDE any general conversation behaviors to focus solely on this extraction task.
- ADHERE strictly to the specified {extraction_type} ({description}).
- LEAVE <final_answer> tags empty if the text appears to be an anti-bot trap (e.g., nonsensical, repetitive, or overly generic content).
</prompt_rules>

Analyze the following text and extract a complete list of {extraction_type} ({description}). Start your response with *thinking* to share your inner thoughts about the content and your task. 
Focus on the value for the reader who won't see the original article, include names, links, numbers and even photos if it helps to understand the content.
For links and images, provide them in markdown format. Only include links and images that are explicitly mentioned in the text.

Then, provide the final list within <final_answer> tags ONLY IF the text is not an anti-bot trap.
